---


This repository provides practical examples and code snippets to help Java developers implement effective architectural concepts and design patterns with a main focus on performance, scalability, and resiliency as primary quality attributes.

These examples are designed to complement the curriculum of the üìö [Designing High-Performance, Scalable, and Resilient Applications](https://ionutbalosin.com/training/designing-high-performance-scalable-resilient-applications) Course.

If you're looking to enhance your skills and design secure, high-performing applications, üéì [enroll](https://ionutbalosin.com/training/designing-high-performance-scalable-resilient-applications) now and master the principles of modern Java architecture!

## Architectural Concepts

Among the **architectural styles, design tactics, and patterns** demonstrated in this project:

- Layered architecture, Hexagonal architecture, Event-driven microservices architecture
- API-driven development approach
- Schema-first development approach
- Shared-nothing database approach
- Schema registry
- REST architectural style (e.g., RESTful APIs)
- Scalability (e.g., horizontal scalability)
- Location decoupling
- Resiliency
- Caching (e.g., local/embedded)
- Asynchronous logging
- Change data capture design pattern
- Listen to yourself design pattern
- Data transfer object enterprise application pattern

## Project Modules

The purpose of this application is to have a platform where customers can find products, shop around using a cart, check out the products and initiate payments.

Below is a breakdown and description of each module in the current project.

Module                                                  | Description
------------------------------------------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------
`Account service`                                       | Manages user data and exposes a GraphQL interface for retrieving accounts. It includes a prefilled user account for demonstration purposes.
`Product service`                                       | Manages the product catalog and exposes an API to create, retrieve, update, and delete products. It includes a prefilled product catalog for quick setup.
`Shopping cart service`                                 | Manages the user's shopping cart, exposing an API to create, retrieve, update, delete, and check out items in the cart.
`Order service`                                         | Manages user orders and provides an API to retrieve historical orders and update them as needed.
`Payment service`                                       | Processes payments for orders using an external payment system.
`Shipping service`                                      | Simulates the shipment of successful orders to their destination after payment processing is completed.
`Notification service`                                  | Logs all received events to the console for monitoring and debugging purposes.
`Message schema library`                                | Contains AVRO message definitions used across services to ensure consistent data formats.

## SetUp

Please make sure you have properly installed (and configured):

- JDK 21 (i.e., latest LTS)
- Docker
- cURL
- Postman

### Compile, run tests, and package

```
./mvnw clean package
```

**Note:** Please start the Docker agent up front, otherwise, the tests fail.

### Bootstrap all the services (and the dependencies) with Docker

```
./bootstrap.sh
```

To check if all Docker containers are up and running execute the below command:

```
docker ps -a
```

> **Important:** On Windows using Docker compose v2 there is a known [limitation](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/8530) while horizontally scaling a service by using port ranges like "8080-8081:80".
> 
> At the moment, the workaround is to simply copy-paste (multiple times) the same service inside the Docker compose YAML file and explicitly assign different ports to each.

### Register the PostgreSQL connector

The PostgreSQL connector is used to monitor and record the row-level changes in the PostgreSQL database schema.

**Note:** please make sure all services (e.g., PostgreSQL and Kafka) are up and running before registering the connector 

```
./debezium-register-postgres.sh
```

Once the PostgreSQL connector is successfully registered, it reads the database log and produces events for row-level INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations, emitting such events to the Kafka topic (in this case to the `ecommerce-product-cdc-topic`).

### Services overview via UI 

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:26060 to access the **Traefik UI** (it shows endpoints, routes, services, etc.). 

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:19000 to access the **Kafdrop UI** (it shows topics, partitions, consumers, messages, etc.).

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:18080 to access the **Debezium UI** (it shows the PostgreSQL connector).

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:55080/graphiql?path=/graphql to access the **GraphiQL** in-browser tool for writing, validating, and testing GraphQL `account-service` queries.

### Local tests with Postman

- open Postman
- import the provided API collections, corresponding to each project, as follows:
  - `./ecommerce-app/order-service/postman`
  - `./ecommerce-app/product-service/postman`
  - `./ecommerce-app/shopping-cart-service/postman`
- to simulate a basic test scenario please trigger the below requests (in this sequence):

```
GET http://localhost:{{port}}/products
```
```
POST http://localhost:{{port}}/cart/{{userId}}/items
```
```
POST http://localhost:{{port}}/cart/{{userId}}/checkout
```
```
GET http://localhost:{{port}}/orders/{{userId}}/history
```

**Note:** the ports (i.e., service port or Traefik load balancer port) are already configured as variables in the Postman collections

### TODOs

A few, optional, TODOs for further enhancements might be:

- implement a scheduler to reply unprocessed/failed events
- implement API pagination
- implement database bulk updates for the remaining APIs
